For some, skincare is a chore. But for some others, skincare is a hobby… a pretty expensive one. With that, comes the piles of free samples that more often than not, end up unused. What better way is there than to spread the love and pass it on to someone else who wants it?

SI(S)C, an abbreviation of Sharing is (Skin)Caring, aims to be a local skincare community inspired by subreddits like AsianBeauty, SkincareAddiction, SkincareExchange (and more), where users can safely sell, give away unwanted samples, request and even provide reviews.


**You may ask, Why SI(S)C even though platforms like Carousell exists?**

SI(S)C is actually inspired by Carousell’s selling & ‘looking for’ system, minus all the troublesome filtering you'll have to go through to reach a certain section. It's a site purely dedicated to skincare! (Plus it's always nice to know that you're dealing with people who share the same interest as you).


**As the site owner, I want to:**
- build a safe community for local skincare enthusiasts
- allow users to interact, sell, request and provide reviews(which will be especially helpful since we're all living in the same country and experiencing the same weather! Having a similar factor can help people determine whether a product might or might not work for them)


**As the end user, I want to:**
- be a part of a local skincare community
- sell or give away unwanted samples or products
- request for products
- contribute reviews on products I've tried before
